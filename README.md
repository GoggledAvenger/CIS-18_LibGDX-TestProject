Individual - Sprint 3

This time I don't have any code to upload so I'll do another readme.
I was meaning to play around with the extended simple game but Gabe had already set up something for us to play with.

My User Story was #116 Learn how to generate and use spritesheets, atlas files, and Json associated files.
As a Programmer I want to use spritesheets and associated atlas and Json files So that I use minimal memory when processing visual.
I researched this extensively. The short answer is after all that the Systems team isn't going to use that method.
That's actually good because the process is so complicated and convoluted that many programs exit solely to make these files for you.
I had a bunch of tabs open on all the various options while I was studying them but they have all disappeared over the break. As it’s not something we will be using, I’m not going to try to track them all down again.
Basically there are two kinds: pay and open source. The pay ones look great and if I did this a lot I'd definitely get one.
TexturePacker is industry standard, used by large companies to assist in animation and game development. They have a free version with limited features.
If you go the “by hand” method of counting pixels and making your own spritesheets and atlases in an image manipulation program and notepad, it’s doable but very tedious. For a few buttons it’s not a big deal but with large sprite sheets covered in close to a hundred little images, it’s a lot of work.
Even though I mostly learned that the technique I was studying was great for C++ games and not so much for Java ones, I don’t feel like I wasted my time these last couple weeks. I learned a lot about the variety of supplementary programs that are necessary for game design. I always assumed you drew something and then put it into a game and everything else was just code. Though you can do that (as seen by the simple game LibGDX tutorial) it’s not very efficient. Supplementary programs that assist creators in streamlining tedious tasks are available from various developers (probably the ones who were tired of doing it all the slow way).
So I finished this User Story up (sort of, I didn’t end up actually making anything because it became apparent it wouldn’t be used). I’ve spoken to Systems and my own team and am now working on map generation using LibGDX and Tiled (a program that takes tiles and randomly distributes them that works with LibGDX). I hope to have more to show next check in.
For some tile samples I made for System so they could test out some code, see assets/Tiles-palette. Originally there was thought about generating terrain while playing but they have decided to use fixed image maps pre-generated from the tiles. I need to get those going so Dylan can start using them in the code.
